Welcome to my python expense calculator. I built this because i was trying to figure out how little money i would be left with after I deduct all my expenses from my annual salary.

to run this program, clone or fork the repo. ```cd``` into the helpers folder and simply enter ```python runner.py``` in your terminal.

the program will guide you through the rest.
